This script requires a list be present at https://bta3062.com/files/list_of_mechs.txt

The list can be generated by grabbed the entire text of the Full List of mechs and feeding it into the following one-liner.

`grep "\[\[.*\|.*\]\]" RAWlist | grep -v -E 'Pilot|File|Quirk' | tr -d "[" | tr -d "'" | tr -d "]"  | sed 's/|.*$//' | sed 's/#.*$//' | sed 's/(.*$//' | sed 's/ *$//' |  tr " " "_" | sort | uniq -u > list_of_mechs.txt`

Then upload it via appropriate methods.
